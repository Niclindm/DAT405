    "## Assignment 4: Spam classification using Naïve Bayes \n",
    "This assignmetn has three obligatory questions which will be grades as PASS/FAIL. Questions 4-5 are optional and will not be graded, but can be interesting for students aiming for higher grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise takes place in this notebook environment where you can chose to use Jupyter or Google Colabs. We recommend you use Google Colabs as it will facilitate remote group-work and makes the assignment less technical. \n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "You can execute certain linux shell commands by prefixing the command with `!`. You can insert Markdown cells and code cells. The first you can use for documenting and explaining your results the second you can use writing code snippets that execute the tasks required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a Naïve Bayes classifier in Python that will classify emails into spam and non-spam (“ham”) classes.  Your program should be able to train on a given set of spam and “ham” datasets. \n",
    "You will work with the datasets available at https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/. There are three types of files in this location: \n",
    "-\teasy-ham: non-spam messages typically quite easy to differentiate from spam messages. \n",
    "-\thard-ham: non-spam messages more difficult to differentiate \n",
    "-\tspam: spam messages \n",
    "\n",
    "**Execute the cell below to download and extract the data into the environment of the notebook -- it will take a few seconds.** If you chose to use Jupyter notebooks you will have to run the commands in the cell below on your local computer, with Windows you can use \n",
    "7zip (https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to decompress the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to submit:** \n",
    "Convert the notebook to a pdf-file and submit it. Make sure all cells are executed so all your code and its results are included. Double check the pdf displays correctly before you submit it."
